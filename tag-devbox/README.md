# devbox

My `devbox` rcm tag is used for machines where I do primary software development.

At least initially, this is mostly for my neovim configuration.
I share my dotfiles across all machines, and I generally want a consistent editing experience in neovim.
But many development-focused plugins install tools like compilers and formatters.
Those are way too heavy to install on machines where I'm not generally doing development.

This is possibly too coarse of categorization for some things.
It's not the case that I need all development tools on all machines where I do any kind of development.
But these tend to be beefier machines (my Framework laptop or MacBook) that have plenty of disk.
