# rcm

This directory provides a local installation of <https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm>, a tool for managing dotfiles.
Because rcm is just a collection of bash scripts, it is already quite small and portable.
Rather than installing rcm on each host machine, I bundle it here as part of my dotfiles repo.

To update this local installation from the upstream source, run `update.sh`.
