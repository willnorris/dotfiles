# rcm

This directory provides a local installation of
<https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm>, a tool for managing dotfiles. Because rcm
is just a collection of bash scripts, it is already quite small and portable.
Rather than installing rcm on each host machine, I bundle it here as part of my
dotfiles repo.

To update this local installation from the upstream source, run `update.sh`.
