# Homedir #

[Homedir][] is a project developed by Christian "[docwhat](/docwhat)" HÃ¶ltje
which allows for "controlling the contents of your home directory via a version
control system in a sane way".

Within this repositry you will find all of my various dot-files for
applications like bash, vim, git, mutt, etc.  Feel free to peruse them and take
whatever is useful for you.  My bash files are most certainly the most
interesting.  I [blogged about my setup][] back in 2005, and amazingly not that
much has changed since then.  I could certainly stand to do a better job
explaining it though.
